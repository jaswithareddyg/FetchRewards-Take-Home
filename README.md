# FetchRewards-Take-Home
This repository contains my submission for the Fetch iOS Engineer take-home assignment.

### Features
- Fetch Dessert Meals: Fetches dessert meals from an API endpoint.
- Display Meal Details: Allows users to view detailed information about a selected meal.
- Search Functionality: Enables users to search for specific meals.

### Installation
This project is developed using XCode 15.0.1 and supports iOS 17.

### Reflections
The code from `DisplayIngredients.swift` aligns with the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) software engineering principle by creating a structured function, `displayIngredientsAndMeasures`, to present the ingredients and measures for a meal. I am open to suggestions and guidance on how to better handle dynamic content in SwiftUI, or any other best practices that could be implemented to enhance the code quality within the limitations of SwiftUI.
